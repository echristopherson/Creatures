<P> There's a problem with a nib file in beta 1 that makes double-clicking an entry in the Genome List not work. I've fixed the problem. If you downloaded the beta before I posted this, please download it again.</P>

<P> Beta 1 is out. <A HREF="Creatures.tar.gz">Download it here.</A> (796k) Beta 1 will expire at midnight GMT on August 31st, by which time I should have a new beta for you to play with. If you don't know how to use the program, be sure to check out the User's Guide, available in the program from the Help menu or <A HREF="../Help/help.html">online</A>.</P>

<P> This is my first vaguely official public release and so it's probably pretty rough around the edges. Be sure to find all those rough edges and ugly spots and horrible crashes and tell me about them. I don't know of any actual crash bugs or anything, but so far it's mostly just been me testing. Please stress-test the program to the limit and tell me where it breaks so I can fix it.</P>

<P> I also want to hear about your feature suggestions. (<I>Reasonable</I> suggestions, please; I'm mostly in a feature freeze here, please don't ask for 3D texture-mapped graphics or a Windows version.) Any relatively simple additions that would really add to the experience would be great ot hear about. I've been making this program for so long that everything seems natural, even though many things probably aren't.</P>

<P> There are two features already planned before release. First, the family tree view needs some kind of zoom and I plan to put that in. Second, the creature inspector window pretty much sucks, and that's going to get a big overhaul. So don't ask for either of those.</P>

<P> One thing I would like suggestions about is the name. I came up with "Creatures" almost two years ago when the program was just a little toy I was using to learn Cocoa. I'm not totally convinced I want to keep the name. If you have any suggestions for a new one, please let me know.</P>

<P> The error reporting is a little rough. If the program detects an error, it logs it to the console and then exits. So be sure to watch that console! Certain things like uncaught exceptions don't invoke my error handling, and so they may simply log to the console and the program keeps going. So check the console if something is behaving strangely, and watch for messages even if everything is fine. Be sure to include any relevant console messages when you tell me about a problem.</P>

<P> Send any questions, complaints, suggestions, crash reports, etc. etc. to <A HREF="mailto:mail@mikeash.com">mail@mikeash.com</A>. Please make sure to include as much information as possible when reporting a problem, and really make sure to include a crash log for any crashes you encounter.</P>

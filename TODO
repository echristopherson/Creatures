TODO file:

done
--------
integrate esellerate
made the document ask for save when any changes are mode, not just running
fix menu items that incorrectly function while modal alerts are running
make StackTrace not depend on /usr/bin/atos (do something reasonable if it's not there)
fix centerInView crash with CreaturesView
make draw panel a utility window
localization support (moving constant strings into a .strings file)
make arena settings take effect while typing // implement controlTextDidChange: to make the control send its action message
make inspector search adjacent squares if the target square is empty
catch uncaught exceptions thrown inside timers (if possible) // not possible in general, but it's easy enough to wrap everything that's timer-callable in an NS_DURING handler
white border for zoom tool
make document icon
update screenshots
add registration info for registered users somewhere

fix crash related to nested function in Genome enableCulling
fix bug where clicking on a tool with the help open generates an uncaught exception // this is totally baffling to me. I think I should redo the whole options panel system and make it so that we manage the views directly -- update: fixed, it's an evil WebKit problem with posing and so on
fix uncaught exception reporting (stack traces)
move Run menu item to Arena menu
make register table in creature inspector non-editable
family tree reload button // if this is going next to the scroll bar, looks like it will need a custom NSScrollView subclass, override -tile
add zoom buttons next to reload
make family tree scroll to the first genome when opened
add zoom buttons in scroll view for arena
add some very basic limits on resources so the user can't easily try to suck up fifteen terabytes of RAM // a hard limit on x and y sizes was already there, but it's now better
allow removal of genome history to cut down on file size and slowdowns when running for a very long time
make icons for buttons

change step timer modes so that the arena runs during control tracking
fix problem where window is always at bottom of screen on startup
update screenshots in help
add key equivalents for things

fix inspector tool not working with barriers
fix where genome color panel changes comment text color
add '...' to New menu item
broken "show genome" button? // it was the square tool not setting the genomes properly
add ability to save to error dialog
tooltips
make genome windows close (and any misc. windows) when making new arena
fix genome list not updated when making new arena, and genome library not correctly loaded

post 1.0:
save speedup
retain ability to read old-style saves // check, but it should work now
birth mutations
mating
better error handling in custom archiver
update docs
fixed genome list crash

ldi now accepts labels
nop now accepts numeric constants
disassembly and assembler windows now can use find panel on 10.3
add ldPC opcode
make trap operations return either 0 or 1, not 'nonzero'
better behavior when PC is out of bounds

fixed broken PC oob handling
fix disassembly of ldpc instruction
fixed custom archiver on Jaguar
fixed zoom tool centering
Added delayed performs for genome culling to possibly remove bugs and improve performance

post 1.1:
fixed neighbor finding code
changed genome list update behavior to be lazy, which gives better performance
fixed window title behavior when creating a new arena

todo now
--------
fix bug where genome list isn't properly populated on initial program load
smooth out delays due to genome culling
beep when stopping due to low population

todo far-future
--------
eyedropper
drag source in genome window
screensaver
networking
applescript support
debugger
more senses for creatures
statistics graph/output
extra tools(?)
